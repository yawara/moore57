# Mačaj–Širáň 2010, §9, Proposition 6

> Let `p = 3` and `q = 5`. Then `Q ◁ X`. Moreover,
>
> (1) if `P ◁ X`, then `|Fix(P)| = 10`, `|Fix(Q)| = 0`, and `|Q| = 5`;
>
> (2) if `P ⋪ X`, then `|P| = 3` and `Q ∈ {Z₂₅, Z₁₂₅, Z₂₅ · Z₅}`.

The `(2)` case excludes a number of would-be subgroups via Lemma 13
and the structure of automorphism groups of small 5-groups.

Status:
* `prop6_case1_card_dvd_135`: **proven** — for the P-normal case, the
  paper gives `|Q| = 5` and `|P| = 3^a` with `a ≤ 3` (Lem 17), so
  `|X| = 3^a · 5 ∈ {15, 45, 135}`, all dividing `135`.
* `prop6_case2_card_dvd_375`: **proven** — for the P-not-normal case,
  the paper gives `|P| = 3` and `|Q| = 5^b ∈ {25, 125}` (Lem 18 cases
  1/2), so `|X| = 3 · 5^b ∈ {75, 375}`, all dividing `375`.
* `prop6_card_dvd_135_or_375`: **proven** — combined disjunction
  matching the Cor 3 odd-list maxima `{135, 375}`.
* `prop6_sylow5_count_one_of_3pow_dvd_27`: **proven** — Sylow's third
  + arithmetic gives `n₅ = 1` (hence Sylow 5 normal) for any 3-group
  `|G| = 3^a · 5^b` with `a ≤ 3` (since 3^k mod 5 ≠ 1 for k ∈ {1,2,3}).
  This is the Feit–Thompson-free dispatch step.
* `prop6_3_and_5`: original True-stub kept for backwards compat.

/-- **Proposition 6 case (1) arithmetic: `P ◁ X` ⇒ `|X| ∣ 135`.** [done]

For the `P ◁ X` case, the paper gives `|Q| = 5` and `|P| = 3^a` with
`a ∈ {1, 2, 3}` (Lemma 17 cases: Petersen-fix `a ≤ 3` or singleton-fix
`a ≤ 4`; the latter is excluded for this case by the Petersen fix
shape forced by `|Fix(P)| = 10`).

So `|X| = 3^a · 5 ∈ {15, 45, 135}`, all dividing `135 = 3³ · 5`. -/

all of order `25` or `125`).

/-- **Proposition 6 Sylow arithmetic core: `n₅ = 1` from Sylow's third for
`|X| = 3^a · 5^b` with `a ≤ 3`**.  [done]

This is the **Feit–Thompson-free** dispatch step for Prop 6.

Given a 3-power `3^a ∣ 27` (i.e., `a ≤ 3`) and a count `n₅ ∣ 3^a` with
`n₅ ≡ 1 (mod 5)` (the Sylow's-third-theorem conclusion for any group
of order `3^a · 5^b`), conclude `n₅ = 1`.

**Why** the paper's Feit–Thompson + Hall is not needed here: Sylow 5
subgroup IS the Hall {5}-subgroup, so we don't need solvability to
extract it.  The conclusion `n₅ = 1` directly gives "Sylow 5 is unique
and hence normal" via Mathlib `Sylow.normal_of_subsingleton`.

Arithmetic: `n₅ ∈ 3^k : k ∈ {0,1,2,3}` and `3^k mod 5 = 1, 3, 4, 2`
respectively; only `k = 0` (so `n₅ = 1`) satisfies the mod-5 condition. -/

/-- **Proposition 6 Sylow-level conclusion: Sylow 5 is unique in `X`**.
[done]

For any finite group `X` with `Nat.card X = 3^a · 5^b` (`a ≤ 3`,
`b ≥ 1`), Sylow's third theorem combined with the arithmetic gives
that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, hence (by Mathlib
`Sylow.normal_of_subsingleton`) the Sylow 5-subgroup is normal.

This makes the paper's "`Q ◁ X`" conclusion of Prop 6 derivable from
**Sylow + arithmetic only** (no Feit–Thompson, no Philip Hall, no
Burnside).

The statement here is the arithmetic enabling the `Subsingleton (Sylow 5 X)`
deduction: combine `Nat.card (Sylow 5 X) ∣ 3^a` (Sylow's third part:
`card_dvd_index` with `|X|/|Sylow 5| = 3^a`) and
`Nat.card (Sylow 5 X) ≡ 1 [MOD 5]` (`card_sylow_modEq_one`). -/

/-- **Proposition 6 Sylow-level: `Nat.card (Sylow 5 X) = 1` from arithmetic
hypothesis**.  [done]

The Mathlib-level lift of `prop6_sylow5_count_one_of_3pow_a_le_three`:
given a finite group `X` whose Sylow 5-subgroup count divides `3^a` for
some `a ≤ 3` (which holds whenever `|X| = 3^a · 5^b` with `a ≤ 3`), the
number of Sylow 5-subgroups is exactly `1`.

Inputs:
- `Nat.card (Sylow 5 X) ∣ 3^a`: this is the Sylow's-third part
  `Sylow.card_dvd_index` instantiated at the Sylow 5-subgroup with
  `index = |X|/|Sylow 5| = 3^a` (when |X| = 3^a · 5^b).
- `card_sylow_modEq_one 5 X`: Sylow's third's "mod p ≡ 1" half. -/

/-- **Proposition 6 Sylow-level: `Subsingleton (Sylow 5 X)`** from arithmetic.
[done]

The Subsingleton version of `prop6_sylow5_card_eq_one`, which serves as
the immediate input to `Sylow.normal_of_subsingleton`.  Together they
give the paper's "`Q ◁ X`" conclusion of Prop 6 from Sylow's third
theorem alone — **no Feit–Thompson, no Philip Hall**. -/

/-- **Proposition 6 Sylow-level: `Sylow 5 X` is normal** (the paper's `Q ◁ X`).
[done]

The full chain: arithmetic hypothesis `n₅ ∣ 3^a, a ≤ 3` ⟹
`Subsingleton (Sylow 5 X)` ⟹ Sylow 5-subgroup is normal in `X`.

This is the **Feit–Thompson-free** proof of the paper's "`Q ◁ X`"
claim for Prop 6.  Combined with Mathlib `SchurZassenhaus`
(if needed for the split form), it produces the semidirect
decomposition without invoking solvability. -/

/-- **Proposition 6 (paper-faithful conditional dispatch).** [done]

Proper-signature wrapper for the paper's two-case `|X| ∣ {135, 375}`
classification: given the case dispatch (case (1) `P ◁ X` with `a ≤ 3,
b = 1` or case (2) `P ⋪ X` with `a = 1, 2 ≤ b ≤ 3`) as input, conclude
`|X| ∈ {divisors of 135 or 375}`.

The geometric content (which case applies based on the Sylow structure
of σ ∈ Aut(Γ)) is deferred-heavy (Lem 17 case structure + Lem 18 case
classification for the 5-group sub-block). -/

  prop6_card_dvd_135_or_375 a b h_a_pos h_b_pos h_case_dispatch

/-- **Proposition 6 (`(p, q) = (3, 5)` classification).** [deferred-heavy]

The arithmetic backbone for both cases is captured by
`prop6_case1_card_dvd_135` / `prop6_case2_card_dvd_375` /
`prop6_card_dvd_135_or_375` / `prop6_3_and_5_paper` (above).
The Feit–Thompson-free Sylow dispatch step is captured by
`prop6_sylow5_count_one_of_*`.

What remains for the unconditional statement is the geometric/structural
side: the dichotomy between cases (1)/(2), the `|Fix(P)| = 10` Petersen
shape, and the classification of order-125 5-groups acting compatibly. -/
