This is the workhorse for the entire §5 table. Already used heavily in
`Moore57.Foundations.GroupTheory.CyclotomicPrimeTrace` for primes 19, 11.

We capture the substantive consequence — "for any rational character
`χ` of `H`, the multiplicity vector of `χ` in the rational irreps is a
non-negative-integer solution of the character system above" — as the
proposition `Proposition2CharacterSystem`. This depends on
`Theorem3RationalClasses` (rational characters are constant on rational
classes) plus the standard structure of the rational character table.

/-- **Proposition 2 (character system, abstract conclusion as a `Prop`).**

For any rational representation `ρ : G → GL(V)` over `ℚ`, the vector of
character values `(ρ.character x₁, …, ρ.character x_u)` (indexed by a
rational-class representative system) is a non-negative-integer linear
combination of the irreducible rational character vectors.

Formally, this is encoded as: there exists a non-negative-integer-valued
function `m` on the irreducible rational characters of `G` such that
`ρ.character g = ∑ (χ irr), m χ • χ g` for all `g`. This follows from
Maschke's theorem (ℚ has characteristic 0) plus `Theorem3RationalClasses`. -/

/-- **Proposition 2 (paper-faithful conditional re-export).** [done — conditional]

Proper-signature paper-faithful form: given the `Proposition2CharacterSystem ρ`
hypothesis as input, for any `g : G`, the character value `ρ.character g`
is expressed as a non-negative integer linear combination of irreducible
rational character values:
`ρ.character g = ∑ i, (m i : ℚ) * (rs i).character g`.

This makes the abstract `Prop` usable as a hypothesis in Lem 13 / Lem 15
starred-row arguments. The underlying Proposition 2 itself is deferred. -/

/-- **Proposition 2 (non-negative integer character system).** [deferred-heavy]

Placeholder for the full proposition; substantive content is in
`Proposition2CharacterSystem`. The proof depends on Theorem 3
(Curtis–Reiner) and the ℚ-irreducible decomposition of finite-group
representations, which is in Mathlib via Maschke but not yet wired
together with rational characters in the form the paper needs.
