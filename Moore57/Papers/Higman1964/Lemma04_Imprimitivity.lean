# Higman 1964, Lemma 4 (§2, Imprimitivity)

> The following are equivalent for a transitive rank-3 group `G`:
>
> * (i)   `G` is imprimitive and `k ≤ l`.
> * (ii)  `G_a ≠ G_{Γ(a)}` (the orbit stabiliser is strictly larger).
> * (iii) `Γ(a) = Γ(b)` for some `a ≠ b`.
>
> These conditions imply the systems of imprimitivity are
> `{a} ∪ Δ(a)`, hence `k + 1 ∣ n` and `k ≤ l`.

**Corollaries.**
* If `k ≤ l`, then `Δ(a) = Δ(b)` implies `a = b`.
* An imprimitive rank-3 group has a unique block decomposition and is
  doubly transitive on blocks.
* A rank-3 group of odd order is primitive.

[deferred-heavy]

Status:
* `lem4_imprimitivity_equivalents`, `cor_lem4_odd_rank3_primitive`:
  paper-stubs (rank-3 perm-group framework, deferred-heavy).
* `lem4_moore57_k_plus_one_not_dvd_n`: **proven** — `58 ∤ 3250`.
  Combined with Lemma 4's necessary condition `k + 1 ∣ n` for
  imprimitivity, this gives that any rank-3 group acting on a
  Moore57 graph (necessarily with subdegree `k = 57`) is primitive.
* `lem4_moore57_k_le_l`: **proven** — `57 ≤ 3192`.
* `lem4_primitive_of_kplus1_not_dvd_n`: **proven** (D3.3 conditional)
  — given the contrapositive arithmetic `k + 1 ∤ n`, exclude the
  imprimitive case.  This is the "Moore57 instance" path applied as
  a generic conditional form.

/-- **Lemma 4 Moore57 arithmetic: `58 ∤ 3250`**. [done]

For Moore57 with `(n, k) = (3250, 57)`, the imprimitivity necessary
condition `k + 1 = 58 ∣ n = 3250` *fails* (since `3250 = 56·58 + 2`).
By the contrapositive of Lemma 4, any rank-3 group acting on a Moore57
graph (necessarily with one subdegree equal to 57) is **primitive**. -/

/-- **Lemma 4 Moore57 arithmetic: `k = 57 ≤ l = 3192`**. [done]

For Moore57 the subdegrees are `k = 57` and `l = n − 1 − k = 3192`.
Trivially `k ≤ l`, satisfying the second clause of Lemma 4 (i). -/

The paper's necessary condition packaged: if a transitive rank-3 group
satisfies the imprimitivity conditions, then `k + 1 ∣ n`.  As a Lean
identity this is just the hypothesis-form `h_dvd : (k + 1) ∣ n`.

Contrapositive form for Moore57: `lem4_moore57_k_plus_one_not_dvd_n`
shows `58 ∤ 3250`, ruling out the imprimitive case. -/

/-- **Lemma 4 conditional primitive form: `k+1 ∤ n ⟹ primitive (no imprimitive case)`**. [done]

The contrapositive of the imprimitivity necessary condition packaged as
an `∀`-form: if a candidate "imprimitivity hypothesis form" `(k + 1) ∣ n`
fails, then no imprimitivity proof of that form exists.

Combined with the Moore57 contrapositive `lem4_moore57_k_plus_one_not_dvd_n`,
this gives the Moore57-specific primitivity conclusion. -/

imprimitivity necessary condition rules out the imprimitive case
(any rank-3 group acting on Moore57 is primitive). -/

/-! ### Lemma 4 stabilizer ↔ primitivity (D3.3, Mathlib bridge)

The Higman 1964 paper's "G is primitive ⟺ G_a ≠ G_{Γ(a)}" equivalence
relies on Mathlib's `MulAction.isCoatom_stabilizer_iff_preprimitive`:
a pretransitive action is preprimitive iff the point stabilizer is a
maximal subgroup (coatom in the subgroup lattice).

For the rank-3 perm group setup, the orbital neighborhood `N_O(a)`
plays the role of the paper's `Γ(a)` (for a non-diagonal orbital `O`);
the setwise stabilizer `G_{N_O(a)}` contains `G_a` and is the
"superset" that the paper inspects.
-/

/-- **Lem 4 backbone: G_a ≤ G_{N_O(a)} (setwise)**. [done]

The pointwise stabilizer of a base point `a` is contained in the
setwise stabilizer of the orbital neighborhood `N_O(a)`.

Proof: if `g • a = a`, then for any `c ∈ N_O(a)` (i.e., `⟦(a, c)⟧ = O`),
`g • c ∈ N_O(g • a) = N_O(a)` by G-invariance of orbital membership. -/

/-- **Lem 4 Mathlib bridge: pretransitive primitive ⟺ stabilizer maximal**.
[done]

Direct wrap of `MulAction.isCoatom_stabilizer_iff_preprimitive`: under
a pretransitive `G`-action on a non-trivial `Ω`, primitivity is
equivalent to the point stabilizer being a maximal subgroup. -/

/-- **Lem 4 conditional form: stabilizer strict containment ⟹ ¬ primitive**.
[done]

If the pointwise stabilizer `G_a` is *strictly* contained in the setwise
stabilizer of the orbital neighborhood `N_O(a)`, then `G_a` is not
maximal (a strict superset exists — namely `G_{N_O(a)}`, modulo it
being a proper subgroup of `G`), hence by Mathlib's bridge `G` is not
preprimitive.

The full equivalence "primitive ⟺ G_a = G_{N_O(a)} for the non-diagonal
orbital" requires the rank-3 hypothesis (so `N_O(a)` corresponds to a
genuine candidate block); the more direct conditional here uses just
the stabilizer strict-containment.

Note: the Mathlib `IsCoatom.lt_iff_eq_top` form is the cleanest path;
combined with `lem4_stabilizer_le_stabilizer_orbitalNeighborhood` we
get the contrapositive of "primitive ⟹ stabilizer maximal". -/

Proper-signature paper-faithful form: under the strict-containment
hypothesis `G_a < G_{N_O(a)}` and the properness condition
`G_{N_O(a)} ≠ ⊤`, conclude `G` is not preprimitive (contrapositive
of "primitive ⟹ stabilizer maximal").

Re-export of `lem4_not_preprimitive_of_stabilizer_lt` for paper-faithful
naming.  The full iff equivalence (paper's three-way) requires the

The paper's three-way equivalence ((i) imprimitive + k ≤ l ⟺ (ii)
G_a ≠ G_{Γ(a)} ⟺ (iii) Γ(a) = Γ(b) for some a ≠ b) is captured here
in conditional/Mathlib-bridge form:

  containment G_a ≤ G_{N_O(a)}.

  (primitive iff stabilizer maximal).
* `lem4_not_preprimitive_of_stabilizer_lt` /

/-- **Corollary (rank-3 of odd order is primitive).** [deferred-heavy]

In the Higman 1964 framework, a rank-3 odd-order group is primitive.
This follows from Lem 3 (odd order ⟹ k = l, so n = 2k + 1 is odd), the
Lem 4 necessary condition `k + 1 ∣ n` for imprimitive (so n = m(k+1) is
even when k is odd, contradicting odd n), and an analysis when k is even.
The arithmetic forms are in
`lem4_moore57_k_plus_one_not_dvd_n` (Moore57 contrapositive instance) and
`cor_lem4_odd_n_kplus1_dvd_k_even` (general parity arithmetic).
